Abstract
Given a hypothesis space, the large volume principle by Vladimir Vapnik prioritizes equivalence
classes according to their volume in the hypothesis space. The volume approximation has hitherto been successfully applied to binary learning
problems. In this paper, we propose a novel generalization to multiple classes, allowing applications of the large volume principle on more learning problems such as multi-class, multi-label and
serendipitous learning in a transductive manner.
Although the resultant learning method involves
a non-convex optimization problem, the globally
optimal solution is almost surely unique and can
be obtained using O(n3 ) time. Novel theoretical
analyses are presented for the proposed method,
and experimental results show it compares favorably with the one-vs-rest extension.

1. Introduction
The history of the large volume principle (LVP) goes back
to the early age of the statistical learning theory when Vapnik (1982) introduced it for the case of hyperplanes. But it
did not gain much attention until a creative approximation
was proposed in El-Yaniv et al. (2008) to implement LVP
for the case of soft response vectors. From then on, it has
been applied to various binary learning problems successfully, such as binary transductive learning (El-Yaniv et al.,
2008), binary clustering (Niu et al., 2013a), and outlier detection (Li & Ng, 2013).

LVP is a learning-theoretic principle which views learning
as hypothesis selecting from a certain hypothesis space H.
Regardless of the hypothesis form, H can always be partitioned into a finite number of equivalence classes on some
observed data set, where each equivalence class is a set of
hypotheses that generate the same labeling of the observed
data. LVP, as one of the learning-theoretic principles from
the statistical learning theory, prioritizes those equivalence
classes according to the volume they occupy in H. See the
illustration in Figure 1: The blue ellipse represents H, and
it is partitioned into C1 , . . . , C4 each occupying a quadrant
of the Cartesian coordinate system R2 intersected with H;
LVP claims that C1 and C3 are more preferable than C2 and
C4 , since C1 and C3 have larger volume than C2 and C4 .
In practice, the hypothesis space H cannot be as simple as
H in Figure 1. It is often located in very high-dimensional
spaces where exact or even quantifiable volume estimation
is challenging. Therefore, El-Yaniv et al. (2008) proposed
a volume approximation to bypass the volume estimation.
Instead of focusing on the equivalence classes of H, it directly focuses on the hypotheses in H since learning is regarded as hypothesis selecting in LVP. It defines H via an
ellipsoid, measures the angles from hypotheses to the principal axes of H, and then prefers hypotheses near the long

Transductive Learning with Multi-class Volume Approximation

principal axes to those near the short ones. This manner is
reasonable, since the long principal axes of H lie in largevolume regions. In Figure 1, h and h0 are two hypotheses
and v 1 /v 2 is the long/short principal axis; LVP advocates
that h is more preferable than h0 as h is close to v 1 and h0
is close to v 2 . We can adopt this volume approximation to
regularize our loss function, which has been demonstrated
helpful for various binary learning problems.
Nevertheless, the volume approximation in El-Yaniv et al.
(2008) only fits binary learning problem settings despite its
potential advantage. In this paper we extend it naturally to
a more general definition, which can be applied to several
transductive problem settings, including but not limited to
multi-class learning (Zhou et al., 2003), multi-label learning (Kong et al., 2013), and serendipitous learning (Zhang
et al., 2011). We adopt the same strategy as El-Yaniv et al.
(2008): For n data and c labels, a hypothesis space is defined in Rn×c and linked to an ellipsoid in Rnc , such that
the equivalence classes and the volume approximation can
be defined accordingly. We name the learning method that
realizes the above approximation multi-class approximate
volume regularization (MAVR). It involves a non-convex
optimization problem, but the globally optimal solution is
almost surely unique and accessible in O(n3 ) time following Forsythe & Golub (1965). Moreover, we theoretically
provide novel stability and error analyses for MAVR, and
experimentally show that MAVR compares favorably with
the one-vs-rest extension of El-Yaniv et al. (2008).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2
the problem settings are discussed. In Section 3 the binary
volume approximation is reviewed and the multi-class volume approximation is derived. Then the proposed method
MAVR is developed and analyzed in Section 4. At last the
experimental results are reported in Section 5.

2. Transductive Problem Settings
Recall the setting of transductive binary problems (Vapnik,
1998, p. 341). Suppose that X is the domain of input data,
and most often but not necessarily, X ⊂ Rd where d is a
natural number. A fixed set Xn = {x1 , . . . , xn } of n points
from X is observed, and the labels y1 , . . . , yn ∈ {−1, +1}
of these points are also fixed but unknown. A subset Xl ⊂
Xn of size l is picked uniformly at random, and then yi is
revealed if xi ∈ Xl . We call Sl = {(xi , yi ) | xi ∈ Xl } the
labeled data and Xu = Xn \ Xl the unlabeled data. Using
Sl and Xu , the goal is to predict yi of xi ∈ Xu (while any
unobserved x ∈ X \ Xn is currently left out of account).
Transductive learning (TL) (e.g., Blum & Chawla, 2001;
Szummer & Jaakkola, 2001; Joachims, 2003; Zhou et al.,
2003; El-Yaniv et al., 2008) slightly differs from semisupervised learning (SSL) (e.g., Bennett & Demiriz, 1998;

Zhu et al., 2003; Grandvalet & Bengio, 2004; Belkin et al.,
2006; Li et al., 2009; Li & Zhou, 2011; Niu et al., 2013b):
TL focuses on predicting Xu while SSL aims at predicting
X \ Xl , and TL is distribution free but SSL is not.1 More
specifically, TL generally makes no assumption about the
underlying distributions, and the true labels are deterministic; SSL usually assumes that Sl is sampled from p(x, y)
and Xu is sampled from p(x), and then the true labels are
stochastic. Moreover, if there is any distributional change,
SSL should specify the form of the change, but TL might
deal with it directly. To sum up, SSL is inductive learning
in nature, and the advantage of TL over inductive learning
is conceptually critical for us.
As an extension of El-Yaniv et al. (2008), the volume approximation to be proposed can be applied to many transductive problem settings, where the differences are the encoding of labels and the decoding of hypotheses. The first
setting is multi-class learning: Instead of yi ∈ {−1, +1},
we have yi ∈ Y where Y = {1, . . . , c} and c is a natural
number. Each of the c labels here have some labeled data
in spite of any distributional change. The second setting is
multi-label learning: yi ⊆ Y with Y = {1, . . . , c} where
yi is a label set, or yi ∈ Y with Y = {−1, 0, 1}c where yi
is a label vector (cf. Kong et al., 2013). The third setting is
serendipitous learning which is a multi-class setting with
missing classes in Sl , that is, some of the c labels have no
labeled data (cf. Zhang et al., 2011). It is non-trivial to see
the distributional change is covariate shift (Yamada et al.,
2010) or class-prior change (du Plessis & Sugiyama, 2012)
from semi-supervised point of view, whereas it is unnecessary to specify the form of the change in our settings.
In principle, all transductive methods can solve multi-class
problems with the one-vs-rest extension. But this may not
be a good idea for methods defined in terms of non-convex
optimizations like El-Yaniv et al. (2008). Furthermore, the
encoding of labels for multi-label and serendipitous problems is an issue when using the one-vs-rest extension. The
volume approximation to be proposed can handle all these
settings in a unified manner, but in this paper we focus on
multi-class and serendipitous learning since they do not require sophisticated post-processing as Kong et al. (2013).

3. Volume Approximations
In this section we review the binary volume approximation
and propose our multi-class volume approximation.
3.1. Binary volume approximation
The binary volume approximation involves a few key concepts (El-Yaniv et al., 2008): The soft response vector, the
hypothesis space and the equivalence class, and the power
1

Some methods lie between them, e.g., Wang et al. (2013).

Transductive Learning with Multi-class Volume Approximation

and volume of equivalence classes.
Given a set of n data Xn = {x1 , . . . , xn } where xi ∈ X , a
soft response vector is an n-dimensional vector
h := (h1 , . . . , hn )> ∈ Rn ,

(1)

so that hi stands for a soft or confidence-rated label of xi .
For binary problems, h suggests that xi is from the positive
class if hi > 0, xi is from the negative class if hi < 0, and
the above two cases are equally possible if hi = 0.
A hypothesis space is a collection of hypotheses. The volume approximation requires a symmetric positive-definite
matrix Q ∈ Rn×n which contains the pairwise information
about Xn . Consider the hypothesis space
>

HQ := {h | h Qh ≤ 1},

(2)

where the hypotheses are soft response vectors. The set of
sign vectors {sign(h) | h ∈ HQ } contains all of N = 2n
possible dichotomies of Xn , and HQ can be partitioned into a finite number of equivalence classes C1 , . . . , CN , such
that for fixed k, all hypotheses in Ck will generate the same
labeling of Xn .
Then, in statistical learning theory, the power of an equivalence class Ck is defined as the probability mass of all hypotheses in it (Vapnik, 1998, p. 708), i.e.,
Z
P(Ck ) :=
p(h)dh, k = 1, . . . , N,
Ck

where p(h) is the underlying probability density of h over
HQ . The hypotheses in Ck which has a large power should
be preferred according to Vapnik (1998).
When no specific domain knowledge is available (i.e., p(h)
is unknown), it would be naturalPto assume the continuous
N
uniform distribution p(h) = 1/ k=1 V(Ck ), where
Z
V(Ck ) :=
dh, k = 1, . . . , N,
Ck

is the volume of Ck . That is, the volume of an equivalence
class is defined as the geometric volume of all hypotheses
in it. As a result, P(Ck ) is proportional to V(Ck ), and the
larger the value V(Ck ) is, the more confident we are of the
hypotheses chosen from Ck .
However, it is very hard to accurately compute the geometric volume of even a single convex body in Rn , let alone all
2n convex bodies, so El-Yaniv et al. (2008) introduced an
efficient approximation. Let λ1 ≤ · · · ≤ λn be the eigenvalues of Q, and v 1 , . . . , v n be the associated orthonormal
eigenvectors. Actually, the hypothesis space HQ in Eq. (2)
is geometrically
an origin-centered ellipsoid in Rn with v i
√
and 1/ λi as the direction and length of its i-th principal
axis. Note that a small angle from a hypothesis h in Ck to

some v i with a small/large index i (i.e., a long/short principal axis) implies that V(Ck ) is large/small (cf. Figure 1).
Based on this crucial observation, we define
!2

h>Qh
h>v i

,
(3)
V (h) :=
λi
khk2
khk22
i=1
where h>v i /khk2 means the cosine of the angle between h
and v i . We subsequently expect V (h) to be small when h
lies in a large-volume equivalence class, and conversely to
be large when h lies in a small-volume equivalence class.
3.2. Multi-class volume approximation
The multi-class volume approximation could deal with the
aforementioned transductive problem settings in a unified
manner. In order to extend the definition Eq. (3), we need
only to extend the hypothesis and the hypothesis space.
To begin with, we allocate a soft response vector in Eq. (1)
for each of the c labels:
h1 = (h1,1 , . . . , hn,1 )>, . . . , hc = (h1,c , . . . , hn,c )>.
The value hi,j is a soft or confidence-rated label of xi concerning the j-th label and it suggests that
• xi should possess the j-th label, if hi,j > 0;

• xi should not possess the j-th label, if hi,j < 0;

• the above two cases are equally possible, if hi,j = 0.

For multi-class and serendipitous problems, yi is predicted
by ŷi = arg maxj hi,j . For multi-label problems, we need
a threshold Th that is either preset or learned since usually
positive and negative labels are imbalanced, and yi can be
predicted by ŷi = {j | hi,j ≥ Th }; or we can employ the
prediction methods proposed in Kong et al. (2013). Then,
a soft response matrix as our transductive hypothesis is an
n-by-c matrix defined by
H = (h1 , . . . , hc ) ∈ Rn×c ,

(4)

and a stacked soft response vector as an equivalent hypothesis is an nc-dimensional vector defined by
>>
nc
h = vec(H) = (h>
1 , . . . , hc ) ∈ R ,

where vec(H) is the vectorization of H formed by stacking
its columns into a single vector.
As the binary definition of the hypothesis space, a symmetric positive-definite matrix Q ∈ Rn×n which contains the
pairwise information about Xn is provided, and we assume
further that a symmetric positive-definite matrix P ∈ Rc×c
which contains the pairwise information about Y is available. Consider the hypothesis space
HP,Q := {H | tr(H>QHP ) ≤ 1},

(5)

Transductive Learning with Multi-class Volume Approximation

where the hypotheses are soft response matrices. Let P ⊗
Q ∈ Rnc×nc be the Kronecker product of P and Q. Due to
the symmetry and the positive definiteness of P and Q, the
Kronecker product P ⊗ Q is also symmetric and positive
definite, and HP,Q in (5) could be defined equivalently as
HP,Q := {H | vec(H)>(P ⊗ Q) vec(H) ≤ 1}.

(6)

The equivalence between Eqs. (5) and (6) comes from the
fact that tr(H>QHP ) = vec(H)>(P ⊗ Q) vec(H) following the well-known identity (see, e.g., Theorem 13.26 of
Laub, 2005)
>

(P ⊗ Q) vec(H) = vec(QHP ).
As a consequence, there is a bijection between HP,Q and
EP,Q := {h | h>(P ⊗ Q)h ≤ 1}

which is geometrically an origin-centered ellipsoid in Rnc .
The set of sign vectors {sign(h) | h ∈ EP,Q } spreads over
all the N = 2nc quadrants of Rnc , and thus the set of sign
matrices {sign(H) | H ∈ HP,Q } contains all of N possible dichotomies of Xn × {1, . . . , c}. In other words, HP,Q
can be partitioned into N equivalence classes C1 , . . . , CN ,
such that for fixed k, all soft response matrices in Ck will
generate the same labeling of Xn × {1, . . . , c}.
The definition of the power is same as before, and so is the
definition of the volume:
Z
V(Ck ) :=
dH, k = 1, . . . , N.
Ck

Because of the bijection between HP,Q and EP,Q , V(Ck ) is
likewise the geometric volume of all stacked soft response
vectors in the intersection of the k-th quadrant of Rnc and
EP,Q . By a similar argument to the definition of V (h), we
define
V (H) :=

tr(H>QHP )
h>(P ⊗ Q)h
=
,
khk22
kHk2Fro

(7)

where h = vec(H) and kHkFro means the Frobenius norm
of H. We subsequently expect V (H) to be small when H
lies in a large-volume equivalence class, and conversely to
be large when H lies in a small-volume equivalence class.
Note that V (H) and V (h) are consistent for binary learning problems. When c = 2, we may constrain h1 + h2 =
0n where 0n means the all-zero vector in Rn . Let P = I2
where I2 means the identity matrix of size 2, then
V (H) =

>
h>
h>Qh1
1 Qh1 + h2 Qh2
= 1 2 = V (h1 ),
2
2
kh1 k2 + kh2 k2
kh1 k2

which coincides with V (h) defined in Eq. (3). Similarly to
V (h), for two soft response matrices H and H 0 from the
same equivalence class, V (H) and V (H 0 ) may not necessarily be the same value. In addition, the domain of V (H)
could be extended to Rn×c though the definition of V (H)
is originally null for H outside HP,Q .

4. Multi-class Approximate Volume
Regularization
The proposed volume approximation motivates a family of
new transductive methods taking it as a regularization. We
develop and analyze an instantiation in this section whose
optimization problem is non-convex but can be solved exactly and efficiently.
4.1. Model
First of all, we define the label indicator matrix Y ∈ Rn×c
for convenience whose entries can be from either {0, 1} or
{−1, 0, 1} depending on the problem settings and whether
negative labels ever appear. Specifically, we can set Yi,j =
1 if xi is labeled to have the j-th label and Yi,j = 0 otherwise, or alternatively we can set Yi,j = 1 if xi is labeled to
have the j-th label, Yi,j = −1 if xi is labeled to not have
the j-th label, and Yi,j = 0 otherwise.
Let ∆(Y, H) be our loss function measuring the difference
between Y and H. The multi-class volume approximation
motivates the following family of transductive methods:
min ∆(Y, H) + γ ·

H∈HP,Q

tr(H>QHP )
,
kHk2Fro

where γ > 0 is a regularization parameter. The denominator kHk2Fro is annoying so we would like to get rid of it as
in El-Yaniv et al. (2008) or Niu et al. (2013a). We fix τ > 0
as a scale parameter, constrain H to be of norm τ , replace
the feasible region HP,Q with Rn×c , and it becomes
min ∆(Y, H) + γ tr(H>QHP )

H∈Rn×c

(8)

s.t. kHkFro = τ.
Although the optimization is done in Rn×c , the regularization is relative to HP,Q , since tr(H>QHP ) is a weighted
sum of squared cosines between vec(H) and the principal
axes of EP,Q under the constraint kHkFro = τ .
Subsequently, we denote by y 1 , . . . , y n and r 1 , . . . , r n the
c-dimensional vectors that satisfy Y = (y 1 , . . . , y n )> and
H = (r 1 , . . . , r n )>. Consider the following loss functions
to be ∆(Y, H) in optimization (8):
P
1. Squared losses over all data Xn ky i − r i k22 ;
P
2. Squared losses over labeled data Xl ky i − r i k22 ;
P
3. Linear losses over all data Xn −y>
i ri ;
P
4. Linear losses over labeled data Xl −y>
i ri ;
They or their binary counterparts have been used in Zhou
et al. (2003), El-Yaniv et al. (2008) and Niu et al. (2013a).
Actually, the third and fourth ones are identical since y i is
zero for xi ∈ Xu , and the first one is equivalent to them

Transductive Learning with Multi-class Volume Approximation

P

in (8) since Xn ky i k22 and Xl ky i k22 are constants and
P

2
Xn kr i k2 = τ is also a constant. The second one is undesirable due to an issueP
of the time complexity. Thus, we
instantiate ∆(Y, H) := Xn ky i − r i k22 = kY − Hk2Fro ,
and optimization (8) becomes
min kY − Hk2Fro + γ tr(H>QHP )

H∈Rn×c

3: Find the smallest root of g(ρ);
4: Recover h using ρ and reshape h to H.

s.t. kHkFro = τ.
We refer to constrained optimization problem (9) as multiclass approximate volume regularization (MAVR). An unconstrained version of MAVR is then
min kY − Hk2Fro + γ tr(H>QHP ).

H∈Rn×c

(10)

z>(γΛP Q − ρInc )−2 z − τ 2 = 0.

4.2. Algorithm
Optimization (9) is non-convex, but we can rewrite it using
the stacked soft response vector h = vec(H) as
min ky − hk22 + γh>(P ⊗ Q)h

h∈Rnc

s.t. khk2 = τ, (11)

where y = vec(Y ) is the vectorization of Y . In this representation, the objective is a second-degree polynomial and
the constraint is an origin-centered sphere, and fortunately
we could solve it exactly and efficiently following Forsythe
& Golub (1965). To this end, a fundamental property of the
Kronecker product is necessary (see, e.g., Theorems 13.10
and 13.12 of Laub, 2005):
Theorem 1. Let λQ,1 ≤ · · · ≤ λQ,n be the eigenvalues
and v Q,1 , . . . , v Q,n be the associated orthonormal eigenvectors of Q, λP,1 ≤ · · · ≤ λP,c and v P,1 , . . . , v P,c be
those of P , and the eigen-decompositions of Q and P be
>
and P = VP ΛP VP>. Then, the eigenvalues
Q = VQ ΛQ VQ
of P ⊗ Q are λP,j λQ,i associated with orthonormal eigenvectors v P,j ⊗ v Q,i for j = 1, . . . , c, i = 1, . . . , n, and the
eigen-decomposition of P ⊗ Q is P ⊗ Q = VP Q ΛP Q VP>Q ,
where ΛP Q = ΛP ⊗ ΛQ and VP Q = VP ⊗ VQ .
After we ignore the constants kyk22 and khk22 in the objective of optimization (11), the Lagrange function is
Φ(h, ρ) = −2h>y + γh>(P ⊗ Q)h − ρ(h>h − τ 2 ),
where ρ ∈ R is the Lagrangian multiplier for khk22 = τ 2 .
The stationary conditions are
∂Φ/∂h = −y + γ(P ⊗ Q)h − ρh = 0nc ,
>

∂Φ/∂ρ = h h − τ 2 = 0.

(12)
(13)

Hence, for any locally optimal solution (h, ρ) where ρ/γ is
not an eigenvalue of P ⊗ Q, we have
h = (γP ⊗ Q − ρInc )

based on Eq. (12) and Theorem 1. Next, we search for the
feasible ρ for (12) and (13) which will lead to the globally

optimal h. Let z = vec(VQ
Y VP ), then plugging (15) into
(13) gives us

(15)

(16)

Let us sort the eigenvalues λP,1 λQ,1 , . . . , λP,c λQ,n into a
non-descending sequence {λP Q,1 , . . . , λP Q,nc }, rearrange
{z1 , . . . , znc } accordingly, and find the smallest k0 which
satisfies zk0 6= 0. As a result, Eq. (16) implies that
g(ρ) =

nc
X

zk2

k=k0

(γλP Q,k − ρ)2

− τ2 = 0

(17)

for any stationary ρ. By Theorem 4.1 of Forsythe & Golub
(1965), the smallest root of g(ρ) determines a unique h so
that (h, ρ) is the globally optimal solution to Φ(h, ρ), i.e.,
h minimizes the objective of (11) globally. Here, the only
exception where we cannot determine h by Eq. (14) for a
specific value of ρ is when ρ/γ is an eigenvalue of P ⊗ Q.
This, however, happens with probability zero. The theorem
below points out the location of the optimal ρ (the proof is
in the appendix):
Theorem 2. The function g(ρ) defined in Eq. (17) has exactly one root in the interval [ρ0 , γλP Q,k0 ) and no root in
the interval (−∞, ρ0 ), where ρ0 = γλP Q,k0 − kyk2 /τ .
The algorithm of MAVR is summarized in Algorithm 1. It
is easy to see that fixing ρ = −1 in Algorithm 1 instead of
finding the smallest root of g(ρ) suffices to solve optimization (10). Moreover, for a special case P = Ic where Ic is
the identity matrix of size c, any stationary H is simply
>
H = (γQ − ρIn )−1 Y = VQ (γΛQ − ρIn )−1 VQ
Y.
>
Let z = VQ
Y 1c where 1c means the all-one vector in Rc ,
and k0 is the smallest number
Pnthat satisfies zk0 6= 0. Then
the smallest root of g(ρ) = k=k0 zk2 /(γλQ,k − ρ)2 − τ 2
gives us the feasible ρ leading to the globally optimal H.

The asymptotic time complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(n3 ).
More specifically, eigen-decomposing Q in the first step of
Algorithm 1 costs O(n3 ), and this is the dominating computation time. Eigen-decomposing P just needs O(c3 ) and
is negligible under the assumption that n  c without loss

Transductive Learning with Multi-class Volume Approximation

of generality. In the second step, it requires O(nc log(nc))
for sorting the eigenvalues of P ⊗ Q and O(n2 c) for computing z. Finding the smallest root of g(ρ) based on a binary search algorithm uses O(log(kyk2 )) in the third step.
In the fourth step, recovering h is essentially same as computing z and costs O(n2 c).
We would like to comment a little more on the asymptotic
time complexity of MAVR. Given fixed P and Q but different Y , γ and τ , the computational complexity is O(n2 c)
if we reuse the eigen-decompositions of P and Q and the
sorted eigenvalues of P ⊗ Q. This property is particularly advantageous for trying different hyperparameters. It is
also quite useful for choosing different Xl ⊂ Xn to be labeled following transductive problem settings. Finally, the
asymptotic time complexity O(n3 ) for solving MAVR exactly can hardly be improved based on existing techniques.
Even if ρ is fixed in optimization (10), the stationary condition Eq. (12) is a discrete Sylvester equation which consumes O(n3 ) for solving it (Sima, 1996).
4.3. Theoretical analyses
We provide two theoretical results. Under certain assumptions, the stability analysis upper bounds the difference of
two optimal H and H 0 trained with two different label indicator matrices Y and Y 0 , and the error analysis bounds
the difference of H from the ground truth.
Theorem 2 guarantees that ρ < γλP Q,k0 . In fact, with high
probability over the choice of Y , it holds that k0 = 1 (we
did not meet k0 > 1 in our experiments). For this reason,
we make the following assumption:
Fix P and Q, and allow Y to change according to the partition of Xn into different Xl and Xu . There is Cγ,τ > 0,
which just depends on γ and τ , such that for all optimal ρ
trained with different Y , ρ ≤ γλP Q,1 − Cγ,τ .
Note that for unconstrained MAVR, there must be Cγ,τ >
1 since γλP Q,1 > 0 and ρ = −1. We can prove the theorem below based on the assumption above and the lower
bound of ρ in Theorem 2.
Theorem 3 (Stability of MAVR). Assume the existence of
Cγ,τ . Let (H, ρ) and (H 0 , ρ0 ) be two globally optimal solutions trained with two different label indicator matrices
Y and Y 0 respectively. Then,

kH − H kFro ≤ kY − Y kFro /Cγ,τ

Consequently, for MAVR in optimization (9) we have
kH − H 0 kFro ≤ kY − Y 0 kFro /Cγ,τ

and for unconstrained MAVR in optimization (10) we have
kH − H 0 kFro ≤ kY − Y 0 kFro /Cγ,τ .

In order to present an error analysis, we assume there is a
ground-truth soft response matrix H ∗ with two properties.
Firstly, the value of V (H ∗ ) should be bounded, namely,
V (H ∗ ) = tr(H ∗>QH ∗ P )/kH ∗ k2Fro ≤ Ch ,

where Ch > 0 is a small number. This ensures that H ∗ lies
in a large-volume region. Otherwise MAVR implementing
the large volume principle can by no means learn some H
close to H ∗ . Secondly, Y should contain certain information about H ∗ . MAVR makes use of P , Q and Y only and
the meanings of P and Q are fixed already, so MAVR may
access the information about H ∗ only through Y . To make
Y and H ∗ correlated, we assume that Y = H ∗ + E where
E ∈ Rn×c is a noise matrix of the same size as Y and H ∗ .
All entries of E are independent with zero mean, and the
variance of them is σl or σu depending on its correspondence to a labeled or an unlabeled position in Y . We could
expect that σl  σu , such that the entries of Y in labeled
positions are close to the corresponding entries of H ∗ , but
the entries of Y in unlabeled positions are completely corrupted and uninformative for recovering H ∗ . Notice that
we need this generating mechanism of Y even if Ch /γ is
the smallest eigenvalue of P ⊗ Q, since P ⊗ Q may have
multiple smallest eigenvalues and ±H have totally different meanings. Based on these assumptions, we can prove
the theorem below.
Theorem 4 (Accuracy of MAVR). Assume the existence of
Cγ,τ , Ch , and the generating process of Y from H ∗ and E.
Let e
l and u
e be the numbers of the labeled and unlabeled
l where the
positions in Y and assume that EE kY k2Fro ≤ e
expectation is with respect to the noise matrix E. For each
possible Y , let H be the globally optimal solution trained
with it. Then,

for unconstrained MAVR in optimization (10).
The proofs of Theorems 3 and 4 are in the appendix. Considering the instability bounds in Theorem 3 and the error
bounds in Theorem 4, unconstrained MAVR is superior to
constrained MAVR in both cases. That being said, bounds
are just bounds. We will demonstrate the potential of constrained MAVR in the next section by experiments.

5. Experiments
In this section, we numerically evaluate MAVR. The baseline methods include the one-vs-rest extension of the bina-

ry approximate volume regularization (BAVR) as well as a
multi-class transductive method named learning with local
and global consistency (LGC) (Zhou et al., 2003).
5.1. Serendipitous learning
We show how to handle serendipitous problems by MAVR
directly without performing clustering (Hartigan & Wong,
1979; Ng et al., 2001; Sugiyama et al., 2014) or estimating
the class-prior change (du Plessis & Sugiyama, 2012). The
experimental results are displayed in Figure 2. There are 5
artificial data sets in total where the latter 3 data sets come
from Zelnik-Manor & Perona (2004). The matrix Q was
specified as the normalized graph Laplacian (see, e.g., von
Luxburg, 2007)2
Q = Lnor = In − D

where W ∈ Rn×n is a similarity matrix and D ∈ Rn×n is

kxi − xi k2 is the scale parameter of xi and xi is the kth nearest neighbor of xi √
in Xn . For the hyperparameters,
we set γ = 99 and τ = l. Furthermore, a class-balance

to minimize

For data sets 1 and 2 we used the Gaussian similarity
Wi,j = exp(−kxi − xj k22 /(2σ 2 )), Wi,i = 0
with the kernel width σ = 0.25, and for data sets 3 to 5 we
applied the local-scaling similarity (Zelnik-Manor & Perona, 2004)
Wi,j = exp(−kxi − xj k22 /(2σi σj )), Wi,i = 0

Though the graph Laplacian matrices have zero eigenvalues,
they would not cause algorithmic problems when used as Q.

The detailed derivation is omitted due to the limited space,
but the idea is to encourage balanced total responses among
c classes. For this regularization, the regularization parameter was set to γ 0 = 1.
We can see that in Figure 2, MAVR successfully classified
the data belonging to the known classes and simultaneously
clustered the data belonging to the unknown classes. Moreover, we can control the influence of the known classes on
the unknown classes by specifying different P , as shown in
subfigures (f), (g) and (h) of Figure 2. On the other hand,
BAVR cannot benefit from the class-balance regularization
and LGC with the class-balance regularization for data sets
2 to 5 in Figure 3 was not as perfect as MAVR.
5.2. Multi-class learning
As commented in the end of our theoretical analyses, we
would demonstrate the potential of constrained MAVR by
experiments. Actually, LGC could be subsumed in MAVR
as a special case of unconstrained MAVR: Although LGC
is motivated by the label propagation point of view, it can
be rewritten as the following optimization problem
min kY − Hk2Fro + γ tr(H>Lnor H).

H∈Rn×c

Therefore, unconstrained MAVR will be reduced exactly to
LGC if P = Ic and Q = Lnor . Now we specify P = Ic and
Q = Lnor and illustrate the nuance of constrained MAVR,
LGC, and BAVR using an artificial data set.
The artificial data set 3circles is generated as follows. We
have three classes with the class ratio 1/6 : 1/3 : 1/2. Let
yi be the ground-truth label of xi , then xi is generated by
xi = (6yi cos(ai ) + i,1 , 5yi sin(ai ) + i,2 )> ∈ R2 ,
where ai is an angle drawn i.i.d. from the uniform distribution U(0, 2π), and i,1 and i,2 are noises drawn i.i.d. from
the normal distribution N (0, σ2 ). In our experiments, we
varied one factor while fixed all other factors. The default

values of factors were
√ σ = 0.5, σ = 0.5, l = 3, n = 300,
γ = 99, and τ = l, and the ranges of these factors were
• σ ∈ 0.5 · exp{−1.5, −1.4, −1.3 . . . , 0.5};

• l ∈ {3, 4, 5, . . . , 20};

• n ∈ {120, 138, 156, . . . , 480};

• σ ∈ 0.5 · exp{−1, −0.9, −0.8, . . . , 1};

• γ ∈ 99 · exp{−4, −3, −2, . . . , 16};
√
• τ ∈ l · exp{−2, −1, 0, . . . , 18}.

Note that there was a distributional change, since we sampled labeled data as balanced as possible across three classes. Figure 4 exhibits several realizations of 3circles given
different values of factors.
Figure 5 shows the experimental results, where the means with the standard errors of the classification error rates
are plotted. For each task that corresponds to a full specification of those factors, three methods were repeatedly run
on 100 random samplings. We can see from Figure 5 that
the performance of LGC or BAVR was usually not as good

as MAVR. The drawback of LGC is that we would always
have ρ = −1 since it is unconstrained. Though ρ is adaptive in BAVR, we would have c different ρ values since it
is based on the one-vs-rest extension.

6. Conclusions
We proposed a multi-class volume approximation that can
be applied to several transductive problem settings such as
multi-class, multi-label and serendipitous learning. The resultant learning method is non-convex, but can however be
solved exactly and efficiently. The method was theoretically justified by stability and error analyses and empirically
demonstrated a promising approach via experiments.
